## 1. Project Objective

This project aims to develop a telepresence system and an interactive game controlled through gestures, designed for people with multiple sclerosis — a condition that can cause motor difficulties, reduced coordination, and limited mobility.

The telepresence system allows these individuals to “be present” remotely within the facility, moving a robot and observing the environment via video without needing to move physically.

## 2. Main Technologies and Components

### 2.1 Programming Language

The system is developed in **Python**, a widely used programming language for robotics and computer vision due to its simplicity and availability of useful libraries.

### 2.2 AlphaBot Robot

The AlphaBot robot is a mobile platform compatible with:

- Raspberry Pi  
- Arduino  

It can be programmed and controlled via Raspberry Pi, Arduino, or both in integrated mode.

### 2.3 AlphaBot Features

AlphaBot offers:

- Interfaces for Raspberry Pi and Arduino  
- Motors for movement  
- Ports for additional sensors (e.g., obstacle or line tracking sensors)  
- Remote control via Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, or Infrared  

### 2.4 Integrated Hardware Modules

- GPIO interfaces for Raspberry Pi/Arduino  
- Motor driver based on L298P chip  
- Battery and voltage regulator  
- Sensor modules (infrared, ultrasonic, line tracking)
